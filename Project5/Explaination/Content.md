Reaction Time game made using Pushbuttons and LEDs.
Connect all the Components given below to the Arduino.
2 x Pushbuttons
2 x LEDs
1 x LCD Display
Coding done such that one pushbutton turns on their corresponding LED.
Once an LED is turned on all the rest of the inputs afterwards are ignored till the Arduino is reset.
This makes it so that whoever pushes the button first their LED will light up.
This can be used as a game to find out which of the two players have the faster reaction time.
